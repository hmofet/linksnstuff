# linksnstuff
PHP code so we can add links to a SQL database

A basic database driven web app in PHP that allows members of the Code Beyond computing club at Sheridan College, Oakville Trafalgar campus, to share links to websites that they find interesting. LinksNStuff was written in less than half an hour, so it is very insecure and shouldn't be used in a production environment. It was just created as a proof of concept.
